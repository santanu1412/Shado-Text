Shado Text - Secure Messaging Web Application

Overview

Shado Text is a secure, real-time, web-based messaging platform designed to prioritize user privacy through end-to-end encryption (E2EE). It uses a hybrid encryption model combining AES (256-bit) for message content and RSA (2048-bit) for secure key exchange. The application ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read messages, with the server acting solely as a blind conduit for encrypted data.

This project was developed as part of the requirements for PETV83: Cyber Security Essentials, led by Santanu Raj.

Features





Anonymous User Registration: Users can join with a unique username, tied to the browser session.



End-to-End Encryption: Messages are encrypted on the senderâ€™s device and decrypted only by the recipient, using AES and RSA.



Real-Time Messaging: Built with Socket.IO for seamless, bidirectional communication.



Local Chat History: Decrypted chat history is stored locally for the session and discarded upon disconnection.



User Discovery: Displays a list of active users for initiating secure chat sessions.



Intuitive UI: Responsive interface with a contacts panel and chat window, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technology Stack





Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Crypto API (or libraries like JSEncrypt and CryptoJS).



Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO.



Communication: Secure WebSocket (WSS) for encrypted transport.



Deployment: Containerized with Docker, deployable on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.



Operating Environment: Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) supporting HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+.

Installation and Setup

Prerequisites





Node.js (v16 or higher)



Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)



A modern web browser with Web Crypto API support

Steps





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/shado-text.git
cd shado-text



Install Dependencies:

npm install



Run the Application:





For development:

npm start



For production (Docker):

docker build -t shado-text .
docker run -p 3000:3000 shado-text



Access the Application: Open http://localhost:3000 in a modern web browser.

Usage





Register: Enter a unique username on the registration screen and click "Join Chat."



Select a User: View the list of active users in the left panel and select a chat partner.



Send Messages: Type a message in the chat window, click "Send," and the message will be encrypted and sent securely.



View Chat History: Messages are stored locally for the session and cleared upon browser close.



Disconnect: Close the browser tab to end the session and remove your identity from the server.

Security and Privacy





E2EE: Messages are encrypted on the client side, ensuring the server cannot access message content or private keys.



Data Minimization: Only temporary usernames and public keys are handled, deleted upon disconnection.



No PII: The system does not collect IP addresses, browser details, or other personally identifiable information.



Secure Communication: Uses Secure WebSocket (WSS) to protect data in transit.

Future Enhancements





Group chat with E2EE.



Secure file sharing.



Persistent identity with password-protected accounts.



Key verification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Ethical and Legal Considerations





Privacy First: The E2EE model ensures no one, including system administrators, can access message content.



Transparency: Data handling practices are clearly communicated via the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.



Lawful Access: The service provider cannot access message content, as outlined in the Terms of Service.
